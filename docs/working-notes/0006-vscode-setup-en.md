# 0006-vscode-setup

Previously, I used KOMODO and SUBLIME as text-editor. I'm currently deciding to use Microsoft's [Visual-Studio-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is quite powerful.

The features are quite complete: **Intellisense**, **Debugging**, **Built-in Git** and various **Extension** options are quite interesting.

On its site is available `.deb` to be downloaded and installed with the help of Ubuntu Software Center.
