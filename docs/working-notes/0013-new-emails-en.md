After a heart attack in 2013, I became very forgetful and the intelligence decreased to only about 20% remaining. For example on the simple but important. Such as Yahoo and Google accounts, Facebook and Twitter accounts, edlinked and Github accounts, and other accounts, after a disaster caused by a spike from a neighbor's welding machine: 'I have forgotten all those accounts.

With a heavy heart, I have to 'become a new figure' even while maintaining an original identity (usually difficult because there is quite strict verification).

1.  Create a Google Account.

    Email and phone card number, in addition to as a communication tool, is currently widely used in cyberspace as a tool of identification. Especially as a security device and data synchronization when signup and signin on a public site. From non-serious sites like Sosmed to important and strategically functioning sites like Cloud Service.

    I signed up for 2 emails at once.
    
    My important profile data is stored in android-phone notes with title `email data`.

    All contacts (without photos) from jstik.ska@gmail.com have been copied to both new emails. For this purpose I get directions from this [forum] (https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/izswAJjcKtY) on Google.

    Now I already have a default email. Account for various purposes. Any account I will refer to the email and the main phone number that I use today.

2.  Email closure on the old Google Account

    The closing, I will do on February 1, 2018. Waiting for the possibility of an important email that is still addressed to the old email.
