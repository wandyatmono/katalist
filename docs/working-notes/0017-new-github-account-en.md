# 0011-new-github-account

The remote repository I selected is Github server. Remote repository that applies git technology that has proven reliable and used by thousands of developers in the world, especially opensource developer. Remote repository servers that not only use the SSH protocol but also HTTPS to make it easier for developers, contributors and other cloners to connect with Github.

I deliberately used the instructions from stackoverflow. Assuming that something that appears on the site is something that is already quite crystallizing.

Nevertheless, I first learned and checked from the original site and askubuntu site to convince myself that what I would choose to do is an appropriate action solution and not cause any problems in the future.

Note: As a learning resource, I use the tutorial at https://www.petanikode.com/tutorial/git.
