# 0014-reactivate-facebook

What is meant by re-activate facebook is an attempt to change
existing accounts and profiles to suit the current conditions.

In addition, I do a lot of unfriend Facebook to be free from a number of friends that are not relevant anymore.

Whatever changes are happening and whoever I have eliminated their existence as friends I have not mentioned here.

Note: The email account I use for referrals on facebook is a backup email account for security reasons.
