# 0007-inkscape-setup

Artworks, I've done a lot with vector-based inkscape. Gimp, which I usually use when I need it, in Ubuntu 14.04 is already installed.

I use the instructions from http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/01/install-inkscape-0-92-ppa-ubuntu-16-04-16-10-14-04/ the guidance is quite detailed.


    $   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable
    $   sudo apt update
    $   sudo apt install inkscape
