# 0003-installing-chrome

The already installed browser is mozilla-firefox 57.0.3 (64-bit). So I use it as a tool to search and download chrome 63.0.3239.108 (Official Build) (64-bit) at https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html.

Chrome installer is available for Ubuntu (.deb) so with the help of Ubuntu Software Center, I have successfully downloaded and installed chrome with ease.
