# 0001-prolog

November 2017, due to neighbors using a welding machine with a non-functioning inverator, my PC's hard drive was hit by a disaster. Immediately broken without trace and can not be saved at all.

It's very frustrating. the backups I have are so inadequate, so only part of my past work is saved. Lucky, because the backup is on the external hard drive. Approximately only about 25% in the beginning are saved.

From that experience, the next development should be designed to be completely safe. With minimal possible job losses.

I also intend to write the documentation and all the records of my efforts in building a new work environment, completely secure, and easily tracked. The new work is reconstructed from the footsteps of past work. As if starting from scratch. From strategy and technology to development, implementation of each work plan item, documentation, and open the possibility to collaborate with other developers.

## Outline of the Development Plan

1. Installing the operating system for 64 bit. Namely Ubuntu 14.04 AMD64.
2. Installing utility applications for development that are not yet available as default apps in Ubuntu 14.04.

    - Text Editor
    - Image Editor
    - nvm, npm, node

8. Development of KATALIST app
    - Reconstruction of old job backups.
    - Reconstruct documentation to fit the planning.
    - Connect localGit to Github and seed commit
9. Continue further work to complete the project.

Implementation of the development plan will be reflected from all development documentation. Both are written in release-notes and in working-notes.

Note:

Instead, also create an account at the professional-community-network to support and publish all my work.

1. Account recovery on stackoverflow
2. Create a new account at LinkedIn, Seek
3. Create a Blogger and Google+ account
